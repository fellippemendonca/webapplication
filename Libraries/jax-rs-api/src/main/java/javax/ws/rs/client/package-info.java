/**
 * JAX-RS core client API.
 * <p />
 * The JAX-RS core client API is a Java based API for interoperating with RESTful
 * web services. It's goal is to enable developers to concisely and efficiently
 * implement reusable client-side solutions that leverage existing and well
 * established client-side HTTP implementations.
 * <p />
 * The JAX-RS client API can be utilized to interoperate with any RESTful web service.
 * It is not restricted to services implemented using JAX-RS. The goals of the
 * JAX-RS client API are threefold:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Encapsulate a key constraint of the REST architectural style, namely 
 *         the Uniform Interface Constraint and associated data elements, as 
 *         client-side Java artifacts;</li>
 *     <li>Make it as easy to interoperate with RESTful Web services as JAX-RS 
 *         makes it easy to build RESTful Web services; and</li>
 *     <li>Leverage artifacts of the JAX-RS API for the client side.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * The JAX-RS Client API supports a pluggable architecture by defining multiple
 * extension points.
