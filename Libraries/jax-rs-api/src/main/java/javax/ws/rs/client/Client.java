/**
 * The main class for creating web resource instances and configuring the properties
 * of connections and requests.
 * <p>
 * This class is {@link Filterable}, so {@link ClientFilter} instances may be added
 * to the client for filtering requests and responses, including those processed by
 * web resource instances created from the client.
 * <p>
 * A new client instance may be configured by passing a {@link ClientConfiguration} 
 * instance to the appropriate {@link Client#create(javax.ws.rs.client.ClientConfiguration)
 * factory method}.
 * <p>
 * Methods to create web resource instances are thread-safe. Methods that modify
 * configuration and or filters are not guaranteed to be thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * The creation of a {@code Client} instance is an expensive operation and
 * the instance may make use of and retain many resources. It is therefore
 * recommended that a single {@code Client} instance is reused for the creation
 * of all web resources that require the same configuration settings.
